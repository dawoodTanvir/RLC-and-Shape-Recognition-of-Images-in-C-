# RLC-and-Shape-Recognition-of-Images-in-C-
 The run-length coding (RLC) enables compact encoding of the image and reduce the imageâ€™s transmission bandwidth requirement. In this part of the project you will design a simple shape recognition procedure. The for the problem are black and white images. First we will store the images in the database, the database is a hash table.
