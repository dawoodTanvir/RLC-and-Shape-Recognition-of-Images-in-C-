Topic: How to run the image processing program.

When you will run the program four options will be shown to you.
1 for Q1, 2 for Q2, 3 for Q3 and 4 to end the program.
When you will press 1 to run Q1 the mean pixel values and number of black and white pixels will be shown to
you.

When you will press 2 the program will ask you for the coordiantes after inserting the valid coordiantes a new pgm 
file will be made that will contain changed image using queue data structure.

When you will press 3 the program will do the same work as Q2 but using the stack data structures.

And to end the program you can press 4 and program will end.


If you will give any wrong input in the program it will keep asking you for the right input.

To run the project you will have 3 options to run question 4 5 or 6. If you will choose 4 the program will run
and convert the image to RLC format then from RLC format to image and will also convert it to negative.

If you choose 6 then program will run and will read 500 pgm files and store them in a hash table.
And you can search the file too.
Thank you.
